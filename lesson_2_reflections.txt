What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git sets up the hidden directory .git that will track git related information
such as commits and log etc. You have to do this if you want a repository to work
with!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- Working directory is just a directory location with nothing to indicate yes/no
for files inclusion in git. The Staging Area offers a way to decide what goes into
a commit.
